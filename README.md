 Module 3 Homework


Python-Challenge
Within this assignment I utilized the skills and tools I learned from class, in regards to pushing and pulling files using Python, as well as leverage the tutor sessions made available. I also was able to meet with other students in order get a better understanding of how to structure my code and used Google for additional online research in how to structure said code. I used the structure and fundamentlas from my PyBank code and was able to use that as an understanding and base for my PyPoll code.

PyBank Instructions In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Your analysis should align with the following results:

Financial Analysis
Total Months: 86 Total: 
-8311.11 Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 (
-1825558) In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PyPoll Instructions In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

Your analysis should align with the following results:

Election Results
Total Votes: 369711
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213) Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892) Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
Winner: Diana DeGette
In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
